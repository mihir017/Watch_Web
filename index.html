                <p class="para">Better spend time waiting for the opportunity to take an action than miss the chance. In
                    Shakespeare’s <span>“The Merry Wives of Windsor”</span>, the phrase is said by a character who
                    suspects
                    his wife’s
                    infidelity, but in fact, it can be applied to any situation when you need to take a chance to change
                    things.</p>

                <p class="para">You can’t keep today’s hour for tomorrow – we all know that, but still tend to
                    procrastinate. Benjamin Franklin warns that <span>is a scarce resource</span> , and if it’s wasted,
                    it
                    cannot be
                    recovered later. This is why mindful planning and work on productivity are so important.</p>

                <p class="para">Ancient Greek philosophy is known by its combination of merely theoretical thoughts and
                    practical approach. Theophrastus understood time as an accident of motion that cannot be stopped or
                    reversed, and he said that waste of time is the most extravagant and costly of all expenses.</p>
